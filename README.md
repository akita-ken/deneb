A simple flat-file content management system written in PHP.

Built on the [Slim Microframework](http://www.slimframework.com) and implementing the [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org) templating engine.

## Requirements

Clone the repo into your server's document root (or wherever you want it to be), and then do a

`composer update`

to get all the necessary dependencies.

## Documentation
Coming soon

## Additional information
This project was mostly a means for me to practice developing PHP applications (in addition to its primary purpose of running my personal site). I intend to continue extending its functionality as and when time permits.
