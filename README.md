![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/release-v0.1.0-blue.svg)

A simple flat-file content management system written in PHP.

Built on the [Slim Microframework](http://www.slimframework.com) and implementing the [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org) templating engine.

## Requirements

* Nginx or Apache with mod_rewrite (other servers may work, but have not been tested)
* PHP 5.5.0 or later
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

## Installation
Clone the repo into your server's document root (or wherever you want it to be), and then do a

`composer update`

to get all the necessary dependencies.

### Additional considerations
The server must have write permissions to the document root, as well as the configuration file path that you set in the first-run setup.

## Documentation
Coming soon

## Additional information
This project was mostly a means for me to practice developing PHP applications (in addition to its primary purpose of running my personal site). I intend to continue extending its functionality as and when time permits.
